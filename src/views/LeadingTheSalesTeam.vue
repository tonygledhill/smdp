            <h2>LEADING THE SALES TEAM</h2>
            <p>It is the role of every Sales Team Leader to put individuals they are responsible for, in the best possible situation to deliver individual targets and consequently the goals of the Organisation.</p>
            <p>The saying “DIFFERENT STROKES FOR DIFFERENT FOLKS” should be a key tenet of every Sales Team Leader.  Individuals need to be treated differently to deliver this.  We are all different and we all respond to different approaches.</p>
            <p>SMDP takes a three step approach to practical Leadership:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>DIAGNOSE the individual needs and motivators of each member of the Team</li>
                <li>PLAN how you will lead the individual and what behavioural changes they need to make</li>
                <li>Take ACTION to motivate the individuals, based on well established Leadership techniques, which have been personalised, through personal experience, for a Sales Team environment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We work face to face with Team Leaders to deliver proven techniques and actions to support their development in Leading the Sales Team.</p>
